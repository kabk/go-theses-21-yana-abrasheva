            <p> During the last years of the Holocene, humans have become the dominating breathing species on planet Earth. Supposedly the Anthropocene *as a speculative geological epoch* has put organic life *as humans know it* in a precarious position?</p>
            <p> In this thesis I would like to explore the topic of ecology and ethics surrounding the contemporary society, with a focus on the
              technological industry. The focus grows into exploring radical asceticism of technology and the fact that maybe it is not the most efficient movement for a change, while exploring a speculative scenario in which the tech-society we live in supposedly has come to an end and exists only in the form of tales told in front of the fire of a futuristic tech-ascetic tribe. The thesis continues by exploring scientific discoveries concentrated on finding species that can digest plastics and toxic pollutions. It tries to show different groups of species (real and speculative) that arose due to the conditions of the current geo-political landscapes. To come in an end of fictional narrative of a society inhabiting an unexisting land. Co-existing with mutated species that arose due to the extreme environmental changes that habitats are facing. Humans and non-human species living hand by hand in equal hierarchy.</p>
            <p> With the help of different aspects of storytelling, like the dialogical form of writing, or a fiction-based intrusion here or there, the text will explore the discourses, facts, opinions, mistakes, and solutions surrounding the topic mentioned. Guiding the reader through an unfolding journey, located in a fictional ground serving as a portal to different spaces acting as containers for cultural artifacts that steer the developing dialogue.  We could look at the text as an organism -- an organized entity, consisting of independent parts. Co-working together towards the well-being of itself. The most important part being the dialogue – the reader could look at it as a skeleton. </p>
            <p id="last sentence"> After all, life seldom borrows gases from the atmosphere, or water from the hydrosphere, compounds from the lithosphere and returns them unchanged. What speculative steps could humans take leading towards a more sensible world, where industrial “devastation” is not swept under the carpet but put to use? </p>
