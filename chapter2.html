<br>Location: In front of the Minotaur’s labyrinth;</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br> When the minotaur was born he was initially nurtured by his mother’s gentle care. Then he fed on the flesh of his surrounding society. He became addicted to devouring the environment around him. Minos, the husband of the Minotaur’s mother Pasiphea, turned to seek help from the oracle of Delphi for how to restrain the destructive power of Austerion. As a result the labyrinth in island Knossos was constructed, gigantic enough for the minotaur to not be able to find his way out,and for nobody to be able to find him.4</p>
<p><b>Protganist:</b><br>Here in this moment I will start my journey, as I stroll in the corridors containing an infinite number of passages and doorways. </p>
<!-- <p id="abstract">***</p> -->

<p id="abstract">About Initializing Change</p>
<p id="setting">Setting : Past the entrance of the labyrinth;
<br>In Dialogue: Minotaur and Protagonist</p>
<p><b>Minotaur:</b><br> Give me a reason to allow you to get past the doorway of my labyrinth, and not unleash my wrath on your shoulders. </p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br> I chose to come here for two reasons. The first one is the fact that your being is the personification of the relations between Gaia and the Anthropos. You were locked in this domain because of enormous egoism, and ignorance towards the world around you. How did you decide that you are superior to other beings and you can take whatever from whomever? And look at your bastille it is an archetype for what we’ve been doing wrong. Thick and high walls separate you from nature, your mother. And these walls made of bleached corals and concrete are surrounded by damaged lands, by your doing, and on top of these fields your trash is fuming. Yes indeed you can’t see them because the high walls don’t allow you, and you never go out of your comfort nest, yet the fact you don’t see them doesn’t mean they are not there. The second reason is, that I think I am capable of helping you, break this curse of existence that you have created for yourself, if you allow me to show you the places I want to visit and the things I want to see, located somewhere in the depths of your labyrinth.
</p>
<p><b>Minotaur:</b><br> You have courage to insult me and my fortress with your small words. Usually I would just vanish you in this moment but to be honest I am a bit tired of living forever… Maybe it is indeed time for a change.</p>
<p id="abstract">About the Conveyor Belt of Coltan Mining</p>
<p><b>Bruno Latour:</b><br> “The real wonder today is how I could be accused of being so guilty without feeling any guilt, without having done anything bad?”5</p>
<p id="setting"> Setting: Endless corridors of the labyrinth.
Protagonist and the Minotaur are walking and walking,<br> approaching the first door.<br>
   Minotaur and Protagonist enter through a door. The Fleshless Narrator is also accompanying
them silently.<br>
In Dialogue: Narrator and Protagonist</p>
<p><b>Curator:</b><br>  “Sucks you through its screen and pulls you through the rabbit hole of electronic connections that spit you out on the other side of the world in a muddy mine in eastern Congo with people staring you in your white face wondering where you came from all of a sudden and why you’re so interested in the things they’re digging out of the ground since only ten years ago nobody cared about the black ore that is dust in rivers or nuggets in old tin mines abandoned by the companies that officially still have the licenses to dig”6</p>
<p id="setting"> Setting: The old stone brick corridor has all of a sudden changed into a white sterile space. <br> white cube, its only purpose to emphasize the lonely standing, dimly lit artwork in it.<br>
The name of the artwork and creators are: Revital Cohen and Tuur van Balen - Mine</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br> I’m wondering what is the name of the artwork, what is it about? </p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b></br> What can you see? </p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br> I see a mountain of shiny, destroyed hard drives</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>And what does it make you think about?</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br> About my own computer, my ipad, my phone that is currently sitting quietly in my pocket, all of my old phones laying in a drawer at home, and the hard drives and usbs I am using on a daily basis. But what is it, can you tell me? </p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>The installation explores manufacturing processes as cultural, ethical, and political phenomenons. It is titled “b/NdAlTaAu” standing for the names of the compounds:  Neodymium (Nd), aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), gold (Au). The artwork is made by a design studio located in London going by the name of Revital Cohen and Tuur Van Balen.7</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br> What is this thing you mentioned tantalum?
</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>Without tantalum there would be no connections. It is used for manufacture of tantalum capacitors that are found in most electronic devices like your laptop. It is extracted from the metallic ore known as Columbite-Tantalite also more popularly known as its shorter name Coltan. Most of the Coltan resources are situated in the Eastern part of the DRC.</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br>Does the extraction of this ore include ethical and environmentally progressive labor practices?</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br> Imagine how much the Coltan industry is worth, especially if it is necessary for the products of corporations like Macintosh, Samsung group, etc. Congo is devastated by ecological disasters derived from mining, since the coltan as other ores needs water rinsing/dreading to be obtained and the slurry that it releases is hazardous to ecosystems. As well as it doesn’t only strip the land from minerals but also degrades the soil. In towns where coltan is the main means of economical survival it leaves the soil dead, unsustainable for food produce or vegetation of any kind. Well, this is not where it ends. After 1997 and the death of the dictator Mobutu, Congo has been constantly ruptured by internal conflicts. It is easy to see the shadow of late capitalism in them.8</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br>Why?</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>The eastern part of Congo, where most of the coltan is separated into multiple territories ruled by warlords that are defending their land with some sort of army. Not surprisingly the warlords have business connections with foreign companies that want to mine the different minerals found in the country. It fits both of the sides the western corporations get to mine without paying taxes, while the warlords get a respectful fee in return.9
</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br> People are still buying  the new model phone when it comes out, owning more than 2 cars, having TVs in every bedroom at home. Not only the more excessive consumerism participates in causing the problem. I, as a “creative” person who mainly works on a computer, work with at least a scanner, a drawing pad, a smartphone, a printer, a kindle, I currently own two hard-drives etc. So even if I am not from the upper mentioned group of society I still contribute to the industry. And now where does all of the discarded electronics go? I don’t think that they disappear into thin air. And all of this is based on unethical labor causing toxic pollution in countries far far away from the western world. Interesting why the ads of the new Iphone do not depict the labor chain behind it but just happy middle class people using the product.</p>
<p id="setting">The minotaur, The protagonist and the all knowing, but fleshless narrator leave the room containing “b/NdAlTaAu”.
The minotaur, his horns encrusted with diamonds, who is wearing primark jeans (also highly unethical corporation)
and inside his pockets has two iphones, up in his bedroom headquarters have a wall of screens to watch TV on, and has acquired
every mac computer from the beginning of computers is feeling a bit shameful about his life choices. The protagonist is mildly shocked from the dialogue, feeling a bit guilty that deep inside her she wants a new computer just because, even though her old one is working well. The narrator is not feeling any particular remorse since he is not interested in materialism.

Setting: Leaving the room “b/NdAlTaAu”, they are out again in the old stone corridors. They take a left turn, then
a right and enter another room. Inside there is a photography exhibition. Narrator and Protagonist keep
talking inside the room.
</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>Yes you are right… Still let me show you… I think if you look closely enough maybe you can find your old phone or computer…</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br>What are these depicted places? Electronic Dumps?
</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>These are photos taken by the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky, and indeed they depict the sights referred to as E-waste spots. At the moment China is the place where all the materials sort of coalesce. The aluminum, the tantalum, the gold, the neodymium, lithium, etc. And multiplicity of factories exist there, that form these materials into products and then ship them back around the world. The products live their designated lifetime and then they come by ship back to China. 50% of the global amount of computers get shipped back where they came from. It is way cheaper to dispose of electronic waste by displacing it to a third world region, compared to properly recycling and reusing them for future electronics in the Western World. So recycling and sorting the electronic waste has become the main source of income of different villages around China. However most of them lack the proper tools and safety measures for dealing with the waste. How the “recycling points” mostly decompose the computer boards is that they heat them up and then with pliers they pull out all of the components, trying to extract all of the valuable compounds inside. The toxic smells that surround the villages that have become e-waste graveyards sometimes can be smelled around 10-15 km before you get there. One of the most notorious e-waste recycling towns now has to import all of its water to the village. It happened because they were smashing computer screens for the recyclable glass in them. But inside computer screens there is phosphor, different types of cadmium, led, and other heavy toxic metals. At the end of the day all of this would go into the soil. Then with rain it would wash into the rivers, becoming worse with every day. 10</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br>And does the corporations responsible for this situation take into consideration the devastative processes that this practice has on people, their villages and the living entities around them?
</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b><br> I am not entirely sure what their policies are. But what comes to mind at first is that they could lower the amount of toxic chemicals and compounds they use when producing, or create better systems for exchange and upcycling of old electronics. Nokia and Samsung Electronics for example have developed take-back programs, where consumers are encouraged to give their old phones. Nevertheless what is still happening in reality is that the market for electronic products is expanding constantly and logically the amount of e-waste is also growing. Unmarked shipments containing electronic waste (big percentage of which is even not recyclable) are traveling to Asia (Guiui), and West Africa (Agbogbloshie). As I said before these countries lack the capacity to recycle safely, but they also lack the capacity to prevent illegal imports. The primarily suffering countries are Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, India and China. It is a frapant practice expanding its boundaries from one continent to another.11

<p id="abstract">About a Reflection</p>
<p id="setting">In Dialogue: Minotaur and Protagonist</p>
<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br>The anthropos behind the chain of events that are fueling the modern tech industry, and generally the consumerism driving late capitalism cannot be synthesized. There is no finger that can be pointed towards you, or towards me, having into consideration that you or me are not the CEO of any of the giant corporations. We also cannot point a finger towards the human race in total. The guilty one is only a segment of the human race. The richer part of the population is the guiltier part of the population.12 The giants are winning the race, and they are often portrayed as reptiles.Then why am I still feeling guilty? And you Minotaur are you feeling any guilt?
</p>
<p><b>Minotaur</b><br> I would say I own a lot of stuff that I don’t use. And I never recycle. That is why the fields in front of my labyrinth are filled with the
Trash I have accumulated since I first started existing many years ago. I feel a bit ashamed now, that I had no idea about this darkness residing behind the shiny products that catch my bored attention.
</p>
<p><b>Protagonist</b><br>You were ignorant huh? Well me too… I think it is because both me and you are a part of the Collective Subconscious Consumer, than is being collectively unconscious about its purchases. The case is not that I have been buying everything that I set my sight upon. I try to be moral in my consumer choices, buying veggies not wrapped in plastic and with less roundup in them, second hand clothes, second hand phones etc. But I wonder in the end do I have a choice, I am still living by the rules of late capitalism that are causing the problem. The western civilizations are set up on top of a dangerous loop of amoral labor practices and production, and then in amoral pollution swiping of waste and grey toxic goo in places where we can’t see it, or smell it, or taste it. The guilt I feel, I cannot exactly describe in words, I get lost in the emotion. What is causing it I also cannot trace the webs of and explain to someone else, it is a far too huge phenomena based on too many causes and effects. After all, the climate crisis is a hyper object right. </p>
<p id="setting ">Protagonist leaves the room. Only the minotaur is still inside. He shares with the audience what the artworks make him feel.</p>
<p><b>Minotaur</b><br> I want to share that “b/NdAlTaAu” affected me. I am used to seeing the products containing these hard-drives and motherboards in a totally different light. With black screens, beautiful metal boxes, strong lit screens with multiplication of colors. The shinelust fully makes me want them – so I buy them. I never caught myself thinking about what stands behind them. The artwork by Revital Tuur and Cohen van Baalen showed me what can be found inside, stripped the idea that I had imprinted in my mind about different products coming from advertisements and the media. It is surprising how much you miss when you try to understand only the cover of the book. I saw how many different parts there are in a hard-drive , and it was beautiful and magical. Green, and black, gold, and silver. Shining as if from another world. I finally understood that the computer I own didn’t drop from space, existing as it is, but complicated extracting and manufacturing processes stand behind it.  The geological and societal conveyor belt and impact of the manufacture of tech products is so immense it was hard to bear.
	The pictures Edward Burtynsky took during his explorations in China were painful to watch for someone that never ever cared about the backdrop of events surrounding his consumerism.  I realized how the individual choices I take contribute to the ethos of pirate-recycling villages. And the lack of responsibility in the industry was striking. Never imagined that the effect could be mountains but not of soil – of degraded components. The life cycle of technology is raw materials berried in soil - manufacture (china) - being consumed - in use - discarded - back to china - and forming a mountain. From the lows to the highs.</p>
