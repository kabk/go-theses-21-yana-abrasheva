</p>

<p><b>Narrator:</b><br>
Living today amidst the shadow of an uncertain future, makes it seem as even the primordial entities are not immortal,
the archaic powers that first sprung from the void of Chaos. More precisely Gaea, the personification of Earth in
Greek mythology, and Ouranous, our father sky.</p>

<p>Let’s try to picture the primitive woman. Somewhere in the open space.
Hunting for wild animals, collecting wild seeds, or dwelling in a shelter, a cave.</p>

<p>The primitive woman is trying to rationalize the world she is living in. Trying to explain to herself the forces of nature, the mutual connections of happenings around her. As a Homo Sapience she is interested in the relation between her and the living and non living world, naturally, but maybe with the unrealized ambition of conquering the world for her own comfort.
	The paleolithic woman is seeing herself as an intrinsic part of the world that surrounds her. She is not perceiving herself as a subject in contrast to the world as an object. <span id="quote"> But as a part of a multitude of other beings, and systems. Living or none, that share the ability of having sensations, feelings, and emotions, that she herself is slightly aware of in her own heart.</span><div class="tooltip"> Living in a sympoietic <span class="tooltiptext">blabla</span></div>
  <span id="quote">world, bound by magic.</span>

<p>The mind of the woman settler that is found in the age of modernity is ruled by the ideas of individualism, and neoliberalism. She has lost her intrinsic position among the natural realm, she has become the subject. She is existing in a self producing autonomous reality, dictated by efficiency, functionality and value.
	The Old Stone age is the world in which the early woman lives in. It is a dangerous one, with an inhospitable glacial climate. She had the resources of her senses and brain to fight the furious animals that she hunted or was hunted by. Her hands to make her tools and weapons, and her magic with which she ruled the universe. Magic is the main tool for conquering the multitude of natural forces that the paleolithic woman is facing. For example by picturing what she wanted to hunt, the paleolithic woman gained power over it. She directed her spear towards the hearth of the animal, and let it bleed to death by coloring the place with red ochre. Only then she gained power over the animal and was able to kill it in real life. The early woman managed to maintain her living position in more unfavorable and hostile circumstances than the ones of today and with less resources as well. She escaped annihilation, she did not perish allowing for her successor to exist.2</p>

  <p>Talking about the successor. The woman residing in the modern era, directed her gyratory crusher in direction towards the core of the Earth, crushing the bulk stones, creating ore and natural rock mines. The more bulk accumulated through various practices, the more elevated throne of vain superiority the modern woman is exerting is created. The modern woman has many faces: the fossil burning woman, the nuclear woman, the accelerating extinction woman, the dumping and sweeping under the carpet woman, the rich corporation woman etc.
	“The scale of burning ambitions of fossil-making man—of this Anthropos whose hot projects for accelerating extinctions merits a name for a” conquered geological epoch.”3</p>

<p><b>Protagonist:</b><br>
  Looking back ten years ago I was 11 or 12 maybe, starting to smoke cigarettes in the prep school in Sofia. Most probably wearing a Benetton sweater and jeans with a t-shirt that my mother tucked in, before she drove me to school in the morning. We were living in Sofia with my family and still are. Speaking in Bulgarian. We would talk about everyday life, or my mom would occasionally fight with me over something bad I did at school, or with my father, that he was a bit more drunk than needed. </p>
  <p>Later I started wondering, how are these Benetton clothes manufactured, where does the plastic ambalage of  the cigarettes come from and what are its compounds, how much time does it take for a cigarette to decompose itself. How are the glass bottles being made, and what happens when they are thrown away. </p>
<p>In the news somebody mentioned that the world will end in 2012. The politics ten years ago somehow never found their root to a memorable place in my head. But I remember the president of Bulgaria – George Parvanov who would always go on TV in the New Year’s eve to give a speech. Then when I was fourteen years old, in February the government fell. Boiko Borisov as prime minister.
	Trying to recall what my emotions were towards this events eight years ago, no particular feeling comes out. But it brings out another really clear memory of anger. When the minister of tourism and prime minister tried to pass a law which would let them start deforestation in one of our national mountain parks. For what you would ask - of course accumulation of sellable timber, but also a vast economical injection from an expansion of a skiing resort. </p>
<p>High school shootings, Arab spring bombings, earthquakes, nuclear devastation, accumulation of waste, forest fires, etc. I guess I witnessed all of this in the news… I think I used to have the defense mechanism of forgetting events of this sort or thinking that they are unimportant to me. With an excuse that I only realized later in my life – ‘after all I am quite a small figure in comparison to the sublime, or to the socio-geo-political landscape in which I exist…
	In the past few years I have realized that this excuse is no longer valid. Today I can say that I am not experiencing the mystical appeal I was feeling as a child. The reason why is the fact that I’ve been a part of the western society for 22 years now. A society that operates with tectonic forces, winning the race of which entity has the biggest geological impact on Earth. And there is a certain amount of guilt I’ve been facing for the collective actions of big corporations and a certain percent wealthier part of the population. While trying to rationalize when the human impact on Earth was boosted by protein shakes, and how exactly we managed to get to this point.
