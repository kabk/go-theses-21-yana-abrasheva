          During the last years of the Holocene, humans have become the
          dominating breathing species on planet Earth. Supposedly the
          Anthropocene *as a speculative geological epoch* has put organic life
          *as humans know it* in a precarious position?
          <p>
            In this thesis I would like to explore the topic of ecology and
            ethics surrounding contemporary society, with a focus on the
            technological industry. The focus grows into exploring radical
            asceticism of technology and the fact that maybe it is not the most
            efficient movement for a change, while exploring a speculative
            scenario in which the tech-society we live in supposedly has come to
            an end and exists only in the form of tales told in front of the
            fire of a futuristic tech-ascetic tribe. The thesis continues by
            exploring scientific discoveries concentrated on finding species
            that can digest plastics and toxic pollutants. It tries to show
            different groups of species (real and speculative) that arose due to
            the conditions of the current geo-political landscapes. To come at
            the end of a fictional narrative of a society inhabiting an
            unexisting land. Co-existing with mutated species that arose due to
            the extreme environmental changes that habitats are facing. Humans
            and non-human species living hand by hand in equal hierarchy.

            With the help of different aspects of storytelling, like the
            dialogical form of writing, or a fiction-based intrusion here or
            there, the text will explore the discourses, facts, opinions,
            mistakes, and solutions surrounding the topic mentioned. Guiding the
            reader through an unfolding journey, located in a fictional ground
            serving as a portal to different spaces acting as containers for
            cultural artifacts that steer the developing dialogue. We could look
            at the text as an organism – an organized entity, consisting of
            independent parts. Co-working together towards the well-being of
            itself. The most important part being the dialogue – the reader
            could look at it as a skeleton.

            After all, life seldom borrows gases from the atmosphere, or water
            from the hydrosphere, compounds from the lithosphere and returns
            them unchanged. What speculative steps could humans take leading
            towards a more sensible world, where industrial “devastation” is not
            swept under the carpet but put to use?

            Living today amidst the shadow of an uncertain future, makes it
            seems as though the primordial entities are not immortal, the
            archaic powers that first sprung from the void of Chaos. More
            precisely Gaea, the personification of Earth in Greek mythology, and
            Ouranous, our father sky. Let’s try to picture the primitive woman.
            Somewhere in the open space. Hunting for wild animals, collecting
            wild seeds, or dwelling in a shelter, a cave.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primitive woman is trying to rationalize the world she is living
            in. Trying to explain to herself the forces of nature, the mutual
            connections of happenings around her. As a Homo Sapiens she is
            interested in the relation between her and the living and non living
            world, naturally, but maybe with the unrealized ambition of
            conquering the world for her own comfort.The paleolithic woman is
            seeing herself as an intrinsic part of the world that surrounds her.
            She is not perceiving herself as a subject in contrast to the world
            as an object. But as a part of a multitude of other beings, and
            systems. Living or none, that share the ability of having
            sensations, feelings, and emotions, that she herself is slightly
            aware of in her own heart.

            The mind of the woman settler that is found in the age of modernity
            is ruled by the ideas of individualism, and neoliberalism. She has
            lost her intrinsic position among the natural realm, she has become
            the subject. She is existing in a self producing autonomous reality,
            dictated by efficiency, functionality and value.

            The Old Stone age is the world in which the early woman lives in. It
            isTalking about the successor. The woman residing in the modern era,
            directed her gyratory crusher in direction towards the core of the
            Earth, crushing the bulk stones, creating ore and natural rock
            mines. The more bulk accumulated through various practices, the more
            elevated throne of vain superiority the modern woman is exerting is
            created. The modern woman has many faces: the fossil burning woman,
            the nuclear woman, the accelerating extinction woman, the dumping
            and sweeping under the carpet woman, the rich corporation woman etc.
            a dangerous one, with an inhospitable glacial climate. She had the
            resources of her senses and brain to fight the furious animals that
            she hunted or was hunted by. Her hands to make her tools and
            weapons, and her magic with which she ruled the universe. Magic is
            the main tool for conquering the multitude of natural forces that
            the paleolithic woman is facing. For example by picturing what she
            wanted to hunt, the paleolithic woman gained power over it. She
            directed her spear towards the hearth of the animal, and let it
            bleed to death by coloring the place with red ochre. Only then she
            gained power over the animal and was able to kill it in real life.
            The early woman managed to maintain her living position in more
            unfavorable and hostile circumstances than the ones of today and
            with less resources as well. She escaped annihilation,

            Looking back ten years ago I was 11 or 12 maybe, starting to smoke
            cigarettes in the prep school in Sofia. Most probably wearing a
            Benetton sweater and jeans with a t-shirt that my mother tucked in,
            before she drove me to school in the morning. We were living in
            Sofia with my family and still are. Speaking in Bulgarian. We would
            talk about everyday life, or my mom would occasionally fight with me
            over something bad I did at school, or with my father, that he was a
            bit more drunk than needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later I started wondering, how are these Benetton clothes
            manufactured, where does the plastic ambalage of the cigarettes come
            from and what are its compounds, how much time does it take for a
            cigarette to decompose itself. How are the glass bottles being made,
            and what happens when they are thrown away.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the news somebody mentioned that the world will end in 2012. The
            politics ten years ago somehow never found their root to a memorable
            place in my head. But I remember the president of Bulgaria – George
            Parvanov who would always go on TV in the New Year’s eve to give a
            speech. Then when I was fourteen years old, in February the
            government fell. Boiko Borisov as prime minister.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trying to recall what my emotions were towards this events eight
            years ago, no particular feeling comes out. But it brings out
            another really clear memory of anger. When the minister of tourism
            and prime minister tried to pass a law which would let them start
            deforestation in one of our national mountain parks. For what you
            would ask - of course accumulation of sellable timber, but also a
            vast economical injection from an expansion of a skiing resort. High
            school shootings, Arab spring bombings, earthquakes, nuclear
            devastation, accumulation of waste, forest fires, etc. I guess I
            witnessed all of this in the news… I think I used to have the
            defense mechanism of forgetting events of this sort or thinking that
            they are unimportant to me. With an excuse that I only realized
            later in my life – ‘after all I am quite a small figure in
            comparison to the sublime, or to the socio-geo-political landscape
            in which I exist…
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past few years I have realized that this excuse is no longer
            valid. Today I can say that I am not experiencing the mystical
            appeal I was feeling as a child. The reason why is the fact that
            I’ve been a part of the western society for 22 years now. A society
            that operates with tectonic forces, winning the race of which entity
            has the biggest geological impact on Earth. And there is a certain
            amount of guilt I’ve been facing for the collective actions of big
            corporations and a certain percent wealthier part of the population.
            While trying to rationalize when the human impact on Earth was
            boosted by protein shakes, and how exactly we managed to get to this
            point.

            When the minotaur was born he was initially nurtured by his mother’s
            gentle care. Then he fed on the flesh of his surrounding society. He
            became addicted to devouring the environment around him. Minos, the
            husband of the Minotaur’s mother Pasiphea, turned to seek help from
            the oracle of Delphi for how to restrain the destructive power of
            Austerion. As a result the labyrinth in island Knossos was
            constructed, gigantic enough for the minotaur to not be able to find
            his way out,and for nobody to be able to find him.4

            I chose to come here for two reasons. The first one is the fact that
            your being is the personification of the relations between Gaia and
            the Anthropos. You were locked in this domain because of enormous
            egoism, and ignorance towards the world around you. How did you
            decide that you are superior to other beings and you can take
            whatever from whomever? And look at your bastille it is an archetype
            for what we’ve been doing wrong. Thick and high walls separate you
            from nature, your mother. And these walls made of bleached corals
            and concrete are surrounded by damaged lands, by your doing, and on
            top of these fields your trash is fuming. Yes indeed you can’t see
            them because the high walls don’t allow you, and you never go out of
            your comfort nest, yet the fact you don’t see them doesn’t mean they
            are not there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second reason is, that I think I am capable of helping you,
            break this curse of existence that you have created for yourself, if
            you allow me to show you the places I want to visit and the things I
            want to see, located somewhere in the depths of your labyrinth.

            Without tantalum there would be no connections. It is used for
            manufacture of tantalum capacitors that are found in most electronic
            devices like your laptop. It is extracted from the metallic ore
            known as Columbite-Tantalite also more popularly known as its
            shorter name Coltan. Most of the Coltan resources are situated in
            the Eastern part of the DRC.

            necessary for the products of corporations like Macintosh, Samsung
            group, etc. Congo is devastated by ecological disasters derived from
            mining, since the coltan as other ores needs water rinsing/dreading
            to be obtained and the slurry that it releases is hazardous to
            ecosystems. As well as it doesn’t only strip the land from minerals
            but also degrades the soil. In towns where coltan is the main means
            of economical survival it leaves the soil dead, unsustainable for
            food produce or vegetation of any kind. Well, this is not where it
            ends. After 1997 and the death of the dictator Mobutu, Congo has
            been constantly ruptured by internal conflicts. It is easy to see
            the shadow of late capitalism in them.8

            People are still buying the new model phone when it comes out,
            owning more than 2 cars, having TVs in every bedroom at home. Not
            only the more excessive consumerism participates in causing the

            work with at least a scanner, a drawing pad, a smartphone, a
            printer, a kindle, I currently own two hard-drives etc. So even if I

            go? I don’t think that they disappear into thin air. And all of this
            is based on unethical labor causing toxic pollution in countries far
            far away from the western world. Interesting why the ads of the new

            These are photos taken by the Canadian photographer Edward
            Burtynsky, and indeed they depict the sights referred to as E-waste
            spots. At the moment China is the place where all the materials sort
            of coalesce. The aluminum, the tantalum, the gold, the neodymium,
            lithium, etc. And multiplicity of factories exist there, that form
            these materials into products and then ship them back around the
            world. The products live their designated lifetime and then they
            come by ship back to China. 50% of the global amount of computers
            get shipped back where they came from. It is way cheaper to dispose
            of electronic waste by displacing it to a third world region,
            compared to properly recycling. and reusing them for future
            electronics in the Western World. So recycling and sorting the
            electronic waste has become the main source of income of different
            villages around China. However most of them lack the proper tools
            and safety measures for dealing with the waste. How the “recycling
            points” mostly decompose the computer boards is that they heat them
            up and then with pliers they pull out all of the components, trying
            to extract all of the valuable compounds inside. The toxic smells
            that surround the villages that have become e-waste graveyards
            sometimes can be smelled around 10-15 km before you get there. One
            of the most notorious e-waste recycling towns now has to import all
            of its water to the village. It happened because they were smashing
            computer screens for the recyclable glass in them. But inside
            computer screens there is phosphor, different types of cadmium, led,
            and other heavy toxic metals. At the end of the day all of this
            would go into the soil. Then with rain it would wash into the
            rivers, becoming worse with every day.10

            And does the corporations responsible for this situation take into

            people, their villages and the living entities around them?

            I am not entirely sure what their policies are. But what comes to
            mind at first is that they could lower the amount of toxic chemicals
            and compounds they use when producing, or create better systems for
            exchange and upcycling of old electronics. Nokia and Samsung
            Electronics for example have developed take-back programs, where
            consumers are encouraged to give their old phones. Nevertheless what
            is still happening in reality is that the market for electronic
            products is expanding constantly and logically the amount of e-waste
            is also growing. Unmarked shipments containing electronic waste (big
            percentage of which is even not recyclable) are traveling to Asia
            (Guiui), and West Africa (Agbogbloshie). As I said before these
            countries lack the capacity to recycle safely, but they also lack
            the capacity to prevent illegal imports. The primarily suffering
            countries are Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, India and China. It is a
            frapant practice expanding its boundaries from one continent to
            another.

            You were ignorant huh? Well me too… I think it is because both me
            and you are a part of the Collective Subconscious Consumer, than is
            being collectively unconscious about its purchases. The case is not
            that I have been buying everything that I set my sight upon. I try
            to be moral in my consumer choices, buying veggies not wrapped in
            plastic and with less roundup in them, second hand clothes, second
            hand phones etc. But I wonder in the end do I have a choice, I am
            still living by the rules of late capitalism that are causing the
            problem. The western civilizations are set up on top of a dangerous
            loop of amoral labor practices and production, and then in amoral
            pollution swiping of waste and grey toxic goo in places where we
            can’t see it, or smell it, or taste it. The guilt I feel, I cannot
            exactly describe in words, I get lost in the emotion. What is
            causing it I also cannot trace the webs of and explain to someone
            else, it is a far too huge phenomena based on too many causes and
            effects. After all, the climate crisis is a hyper object right.

            I want to share that “b/NdAlTaAu” affected me. I am used to seeing
            the products containing these hard-drives and motherboards in a
            totally different light. With black screens, beautiful metal boxes,
            strong lit screens with multiplication of colors. The shinelust
            fully makes me want them – so I buy them. I never caught myself
            thinking about what stands behind them. The artwork by Revital Tuur
            and Cohen van Baalen showed me what can be found inside, stripped of
            the idea that I had imprinted in my mind about different products
            coming from advertisements and the media. It is surprising how much
            you miss when you try to understand only the cover of the book. I
            saw how many different parts there are in a hard-drive , and it was
            beautiful and magical. Green, and black, gold, and silver. Shining
            as if from another world. I finally understood that the computer I
            own didn’t drop from space, existing as it is, but complicated
            extracting and manufacturing processes stand behind it. The
            geological and societal conveyor belt and impact of the manufacture
            of tech products is so immense it was hard to bear. The pictures
            Edward Burtynsky took during his explorations in China were painful
            to watch for someone that never ever cared about the backdrop of
            events surrounding his consumerism. I realized how the individual
            choices I take contribute to the ethos of pirate-recycling villages.
            And the lack of responsibility in the industry was striking. Never
            imagined that the effect could be mountains but not of soil – of
            degraded components. The life cycle of technology is raw materials
            berried in soil - manufacture (china) - being consumed - in use -
            discarded - back to china - and forming a mountain. From the lows to
            the highs.

            A group of astronauts land on an Earth-like planet in search for
            freedom. They accidentally create a new human race, becoming
            mythic-like god figures. The new human civilization is developing
            itself, creating their own ethos and culture, infrastructures etc.
            They stay savages believing in deities, with complex mythical webs
            defining their origins, manifesting violence, fighting their wars,
            and awaiting the arrival of their messiah. Soon the civilization is
            developed on a social and infrastructural level, but they still
            remain savage, skipping the start of an industrial revolution.

            A similar detechnologized contemporary landscape can be observed in
            Walser, a movie by polish conceptual artist Zbigniew Libera. A
            fictional tribe that inhabits an unknown forest is invaded by a lost
            official-railway worker representing the civilized world. The main
            interesting factor of this realization is that the actors playing a
            role of fictional tribe are a real life commune, which inhabits the
            outskirts of civilization, somewhere in Sudeten mountains. Libera
            together with linguist Robert Stiller created a new language in
            which the tribe communicates. Choosing a real life decivilized
            community was a very interesting procedure, his decision to select
            them derives from the observations of daily lifestyle of the
            commune, which in his opinion will be the most adoptable in the
            uncivilized post war-apocalyptic landscape, or just simply
            disconnected from the electricity environment. Their real life
            abilities, and anti-systemattitude provided them to progress in
            pragmatism of organic lifestyle.

            Now that we have this speculative approach, let’s explore
            contemporary societies denouncing technology. The Amish way of
            living is interesting, they fear the impact of technology on their
            traditional Christian world, the possibility of its decomposition
            through promotion of individualism. Resulting in a religiously
            immune society towards the Western hedonistic existence towards
            fanatic individuation, and its telos – the cyborg.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another religious group generating an anti technological attitude
            are Jewish ultra-orthodox Haredi. Most of secular contemporary
            culture products, such as Tv shows,films and games are not allowed
            to be consumed by Haredi. Paradoxically the younger generations are
            finding a job in IT, in lack of other work perspectives,which is
            absolutely against the Haredi rabbis anti technological lobby.The
            inside between-generations conflict of the Haredi is constantly a
            huge field of discussion. For many years ultra-orthodox have been
            working on developing different methods of anti internet propaganda,
            manifesting their negative attitude towards any type of internet
            device - such as smartphones,tablets and computers. Rabbis are using
            gematria in their propaganda tactics. One of the popular posters
            appearing in ultra-orthodox neighborhoods of Jerusalem Mea She’arim
            says in Hebrew: Internet=300 Satan=300.

            There are also activist formations. The perspective of radical
            retreat from civilization is developed by the movement of
            Anarcho-primitivism. Common statement that connects
            Anarcho-primitivists and Neo-Ludites is the abolition of power
            relations, such as domination, exploitation, hierarchisation and
            authoritarianism. Their critical attitude towards the technology,
            origins in the thesis that it carries inevitable alienation, hi-tech
            devices are considered as a timber of an expert domination,
            superiority of power over the average individual. Technology, is the
            product of large-scale interlocking systems of extraction,
            production, distribution and consumption, and such systems gain
            their own momentum and dynamic.”15

        <div class="text-container">

            Anarcho-primitivists dream about the decentralized, egalitarian and
            self-contained society consisting of hoarder-gatherers, living in
            healthy-tribal social relations, disconnected from the poisonous
            structures of social media and constant virtual simulation that may
            dismiss them from the roots of humanity. And techno-fluxus
            capitalists dream of animate machines… “But basically machines were
            not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve
            man’s dream, only mock it. They were not man, an author to himself,
            but only a caricature of that masculine reproductive dream.”16 Amish
            dream of their kids not embracing the degenerative western model of
            living and the Harredi dream of the devil coming to visit through
            the screen of a computer, similarly as to Samara in The Ring.

            The revolutions for democracy that happened in the 18th century were
            promoting the slogan of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. After
            their success of overthrowing the monarchic rain, resulting in
            personal liberty and autonomy of the individuals in a rapidly
            changing economic world. Nevertheless the same people that took part
            in these revolutions continued to live in poverty grinding away
            their days on the land, or in newly established factories. The idea
            of Liberty became hard to reach without the free time to exercise
            it. Equality on the other side became obsolete since the old status
            differences were overtaken by differences in accumulated wealth.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a moment in the 19th century where the politics of
            radicalism shifted from political egalitarianism to a form of
            equality not only revolving around personal political freedom but
            also striving for leisure for all working classes. More specifically
            a shift that would create a cooperative society that could bring
            economic and material equality, satisfying the material needs of the
            masses with minimal toil. The motivation behind it would be that if
            the masses would be participating in the achievement of a true
            democratic politics they should have the sufficient time to put into
            it. In this context the humans living in the Western world were
            viewing the technical advances. The laboring classes incorporated
            the industrial revolution with considerable hope for social change.

            Significantly, Karl Marx, the most influential socialist theorist of
            the last century, identified the achievement of the material
            preconditions for a cooperative and free society with the spread of
            capitalism. He held this view not because he admired capitalist
            social relations but because he believed that a market economy based
            on competition would yield vast advances in technological
            development.

          <p>
            Such advances, he contended, would eventually establish the
            technical basis for achieving the largely political and cultural
            goals of the Enlightenment as well as the material goals of the
            emerging socialist movement. 17

            Don’t you find a certain irony in Marx thinking that a system that
            later turned into strictly class-separatist and naturally/socially
            exploitative socio-political-reality was necessary for achieving the
            goals for economically equaled society? Capitalism arose after the
            dissolution of its feudal ancestors, but in any way did not erode
            the patterns of feudal domination, replacing the notion of feudal
            with the notion of bourgeois. Indeed the capitalist market economy
            that was and still is dominant in the Western World innovated the
            technological world as never in human history. And this
            technological development brought a greater understanding of the
            biological, naturalistic and scientific world. Capitalism served as
            a bridge for leaving the enchanted world of animism and religion,
            and a bridge leading into a rational tech-glorified world of social
            poverty and natural destruction.

            In my research for this thesis I am often really close to turn the
            various institutional and technological achievements that came out
            of capitalism into demonic personifications, and the people taking
            part of this development into a tectonic force, similar to Kronos,
            father who ate his kids, but in a different relation: kids that ate
            their mother. And some forces are demonic indeed, corporations that
            shape the Earth literally, having us witness anthropomorphism on
            steroids as Bruno Latour says in his lecture Waiting for Gaia.
            Corporations as such, described into the previous chapter that
            create a gap for highly unethical labor-exploitation systems and
            dumping of toxic debris into third world countries. And there are
            obvious choices of humans that I see as the epitome of devilish
            destruction. Indeed - Donald Trump leaving the Paris Agreement, and
            stating that “There is no Climate Change, you can get lost with it”,
            and all of his electorate. Or seeing the technical ability of the
            Capitalocene to extract every last carbon compound of the body of
            Earth, as a hungry chimera with more and more heads appearing at an
            accelerated rate. And in truth all of this mythical creatures
            appearing in my imagination when put into a bigger picture are
            signaling the coming apocalypse.

            Yes the human are an adaptive species, that were able to exist in

            participate in almost every process that occurs in the biosphere,

            so-called natural processes.” (Part of C.F.L.T statement.) Center

            Yes indeed this is true. I stumbled upon a study that was describing
            the process of discovering a bacteria that is capable of suppressing
            and consuming Pet Plastics. In 2016 Japanese researchers from Kyoto
            Institute of Technology and Keio University discovered the new
            bacteria called Ideonella Sakaiensis, that evolved in the plastic
            recycling site in Sakai, Japan to which it owes its name. It evolved
            in a complex environment of microorganisms,surrounded by protozoa
            and yeast-like cells. The entire microbiome was proven to mineralize
            ¾ of the decomposed PET bottles into carbon dioxide after prior
            degradation initiated by Sakainesis bacteria. Further genetic
            manipulations have improved the plastic digesting potential of the
            bacteria,they have been combined with enzyme called MHETase also
            found in 2016.

            Ideonella Sakaiensis is not the only post-product digesting
            bacteria. Until 2020 scientists have managed to discover numerous
            plastic digesting bacterias and fungus. One of the first discoveries
            related to the synthetic polymer digestion were nylon eating
            bacteria that have evolved in the waters of the cleaning pond of a
            nylon factory in Unitika, Uji prefecture, Japan. The constant
            evolution of the organisms, their permanent adaptation to be
            destroyed by humans environment, is a natural scenario. After all if
            it was not for cleaning ponds of the nylon factory there would not
            be a gap for nylon eating bacterias.

            as a basis for cultivating mushrooms. Such a post-fecal farming
            process allows to reduce up to 80 percent of diapers mass in the
            period of 2-3 months. The final product, in the form of an edible,
            healthy oyster mushroom can be consumed by human beings without any
            worries. All of the polymer matter that the fungi metabolizes,

            I remember that as a child I got traumatized with the texture of the
            acetic mushrooms my grandma used to prepare for Christmas, that was
            my first conscious contact with fungi. It was a very slimy, obscure
            substance, which for years successfully distanced me from their
            consumption. Disturbing opinions about mushrooms brought some
            insecure perspectives towards the phenomenal world of fungus. My
            parents constantly warned me about their poisonous abilities, the
            dark forests splendor of the mushroom friendly environments always
            filled me up with certain dread. No one ever mentioned to me about
            medical or nutritious abilities they own… For example, my parents,
            and I mean, most inhabitants of the eastern block, were warned about
            the radiative properties of the mushrooms just after the Chernobyl
            catastrophe. Such anti mushroom propaganda was officially widened by
            authorities until up to three years after the catastrophe. That
            created a sort of distant and traumatic relation with the fungi.
            Unexpected environments lead to unexpected mixtures of living or non
            living critters. If it was not for the Napoleon Wrassa fish the
            coral reefs would be attacked by the super expansive Crown of
            Thrones star. The bacteria Ideonella Sakaiensis wouldn’t exist if it
            was not for the recycling ground is Sakai. Analyzing the flora of
            post-atomic Hiroshima, the first beings to appear were Matsutake
            mushrooms. Analyzing the flora of plastic recycling sites the first
            thing to appear were mosses and lichens. In the waste zones of nylon
            producing sites also new bacterias are being born. In Chernobyl
            radio-tropic mushrooms started to exist. If there is curiosity new
            properties of already known entities like the oyster mushrooms and
            cheese forming start to appear.

            crucial property for being able to digest radioactivity – the

            front of himself before becoming anthropos-on-steroids-alchemist
            that is able to transmutate the destructive effect of radiation on
            himself into a booster. What we could do is try to play the game
            again, with the aim of imagining a speculative settlement into a
            damaged land.

            Well I guess I will also have to join. There is a circular going
            river separating an inner circle in your domain right. Because of
            the radiation in it cladosporium sphaerospermum started to grow. If
            you wonder what this is -- the radiotrophic mushroom that flourishes
            in the reactors of Chernobyl and the one that scientists send on ISS
            to test if it could be a radiation shield for astronauts going on
            Mars.23 With time it formed a shield and isolated a part of the
            damaged land into a livable but still precarious for other critters.

            Living critters, inanimate objects, commodities, spaces and lands
            contain in them an important trait: value and efficiency. 24, for
            example, really well explains how thousands of people are damned as
            invaluable by the capitalist system, left without jobs, not under
            the title “unemployed” but under the title “unemployable”,
            disqualified from the labor market. Indeed a trouble in “Paradise”
            of modernization that gave the promise of stable employment. When
            does a land become “unemployable”? I think when its singular asset
            or culture (we live in the era of Plantationism as Donna Harraway
            states) has been worn out. When it was too nourished with RoundUp or
            toxic chemicals from industrial waste, that it is not prolific
            anymore. When does a ship is not able to carry its load overseas
            anymore? When does a factory become abandoned? When does a local
            market lose its value and become gentrified into a mall? For what
            are the bricks of the torn down living complexes used, when
            developper-dreams are being exerted from the grounds.

            A bit of a biblical scenario here. When the lands that we
            transformed into “invaluable” as seen from the prism of the dominant
            late-capitalistic society, they become suitable for the build up of
            new formations of life. Well this is the case with lands in front of
            the labyrinth right. After some time one after another different
            life-forms started to appear. They found out about these lands, from
            a rumor carried by the hot winds circulating around Earth.

            The Shadowbat is a hyper realistic sculpture depicting the flying
            fox, a large bat that has been in a precarious position due to the
            warming of the climate. In the recent year the flying fox who did
            not have the necessity of developing a stronger cooling system that
            effectively lowers their body temperature have started to get heat
            strokes and die in huge numbers. The shadowbat is a proposition for
            genetic development -- a skin umbrella that is allowing for the
            creature to get some shade wherever it finds itself.

            The Cleaner is another hyper-realistic sculpture of the same
            umbrella series made by the Canadian artist Patricia Piccini. It is
            an interspecies creature that transcended its own species – the sea
            turtle -- becoming part sea turtle, part mechanical shell. The
            yellow mechanical shell has vacuum intakes, their purpose sucking up
            plastic from the oceans before it reaches an animal’s mouth, nose,
            throat, skin and suffocates it to death. The existence of this
            species is an ironic shift to the responsibilities that should be
            taken about the problem.

            The smog caused by the endless burning of coil by the minotaur soon
            started to become thinner. It happened because soon puffy to-be huts
            started becoming houses for the critters of the lands. Build as the
            model - Dusty Relief. The grounds of the huts are built with the
            stone debris of the 32 cities destroyed for the building of the
            biggest dam in the world - Three Gorges Dam in Yangtze River and
            their skeletons with the metals and plastic skeletons of e-tech
            waste found around the world. The cluster of them is a house for
            ergonomic speculations. An oikos taking Louise Bourgeois’ Maman for
            an emblem, revolving around deep-ecological concepts respecting the
            past and the present which will lead to an uncertain future. Build

            co-exist with instead of reshuffling them and locating them into a

            The dance of darkness, I am observing, can be understood as an
            allegory of the rapid and traumatic transformations and
            rearrangements of ecosystems and the losses that animal and plant
            species are facing. As well as the geological trauma that the human
            species has been exerting on Earth, literally reshaping its masses.
            Mining, infrastructalisation, agriculture etc. All these cultures
            can be seen as a map of violently inscribed events onto its crust. I

            Butoh is a cultural phenomena, avant-garde dance, that arose in
            post-war Japan during the 1950s. It is an art practice that explores
            the connection between the body and the mind coping mechanism,
            initially connected to the war and nuclear traumas that the Japanese
            experienced.

            I am Slowly convulsing and my limbs are twitching under the weight
            of my transformation and the destinies that are awaiting my
            predecessors. Contracting in the contact with the reminder that we
            are dealing with physical entities, with fatal toxic power. Twenty
            thousand years from now nobody would be an empathetic and meaningful
            relative of mine. Nevertheless life twenty thousand years from now
            will be fully influenced by the decisions in which I participate
            right now. The modern human is participating in Derek Parfit’s
            Prisoner dilemmas, regarding the toxic outlasting of her entities
            (pollution, nuclear radiation) and my future predecessors.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I am dancing I am wondering who let the body be objectified by
            the creation of meaning? What is a hand? What is a leg? What is a
            choreography? 32 Why are we living in a world? What is an
            environment. It is the human made concept of his existence,a
            particular region or group of countries or all the countries and
            people living on earth. Some dancers memorize the sentences created
            by gestures, the meaning of their dances and reproduce them in front
            of an audience. However in Butoh pure reproduction of movements is
            impossible because of the motoric perception of the movement
            “syllable” - a fragmental movement - would not be limited and
            determined, and it might include bodily reflexive distortions or
            tremors”. 33 Living in deep ecological times our _ _ _ _ _ cannot be
            limited to the word world, environment, ecosystem etc. When I look
            for our world I just find life-forms and non life-forms and their
            relationship. A _ _ _ _ _ consisting of “grass, iron ore, Popsicles,
            sunlight, the galaxy Sagittarius, and mushroom spores. Earth exists,
            no doubt, but not as some special enormous bowl that contains all
            the “ecological” objects. Earth is one object coexisting with mice,
            sugar, elephants, and Turin.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In Butoh the dancer could be dancing but the audience will not be
            able to see it. It is a deviated dance not performed for the
            preliminary senses. An example of a deviated movement is when now I
            continue my dance by shifting air flow from my left lung to the
            right one, but my body stay still. 35 Another example is the
            deviation of flows and processes. I am talking about flows shunted
            in some less powerful group’s domain. The Chinese citizens must deal
            with toxic e-tech waste. The African family must deal with different
            chemical run-offs. The people of the Marshall islands must deal with
            enormous amount of radioactive slurry that the Americans left there.

            Yin-yang relationship in which the black represents the pigment
            contained in the cladosporium sphaerospermum. In traditional Chinese
            antic philosophy and metaphysics, Yin is also the female force of
            the Earth. And the white part becomes an allegory of the
            white*dominated*-western-capital-driven monster and their desires of
            burning Earth resources for the growth of capital. The white power
            in the traditional Chinese system represents brightness growth and
            passion. But The case for the reality in which I am existing is the
            bright prospect of growth and passion grew into hyper-exploitative
            unethical greed, and became an allegory of it. The aim of Butoh is
            to face your psychology. The dancer is facing the traumas imprinted
            on himself and by dancing he is healing them. Now that my dance is
            coming to an end, I feel liberated. The burning feeling of ignorance
            that I was feeling by unlearning what I knew about the world is
            starting to fade. It opens up space for a new existence in which the
            curse of me being immortal and forever trapped in the egoistic
            choices I have made is being lifted. I believe that more and more
            young earthlings are gaining awareness about the destructive
            practices of late capitalism. Attempting to disenchant themselves
            from the spell that society casts on them. The first step to take is
            descending from the top of the food chain, in a way. You know,
            renouncing their superiority. Breaking their interdependencies with
            industries that are reforming Earth in vast paces, or engaging with
            highly unethical labor practices. Not being afraid of changing the
            landscape we are used to – transferring from underground oil pipes
            and coal mines to outer-ground wind turbines. Starting to look at
            other species like at their own brother – next time maybe you will
            think twice before destroying the spider web you have seen, because
            the spider species seem disgusting to you, also on a totally other
            note do you remember that time you would have like to eat meat, no I
            am not saying do not eat meat. First think how fucked up is
            everything connected to this meat you are holding in the supermarket
            area. Meat that was never something else except fur maybe, and was
            grown in a cage. Think would you like to be grown in a cage and be
            meat. Well I guess the moral of the story is please threat the other
            species as you would like to be threated. While descending the
            staircase of being on top of the food chain, the earthling is also
            learning that species is not only the specie of Amanita Muscaria
            mushroom or the specie or the Napoleon Wrasse fish,it is also the
            specie of “huge amount of nuclear trash we need to deal with” or the
            specie of “green house effect we need to deal with” or the specie of
            “maybe there shouldn’t be more oil spills we on while thinking about
            those topics. Yes all of them have feelings, this is what I
            understood in my journey. Maybe collectively we can decrease the
            amount of hurt that is being exerted on them. If you were a child
            growing up in Bulgaria like me, you must have heard of the tale “The
            Grandpa’s Glove”. For the ones that are not I will tell you shortly
            what it is about.

            A grandfather left a village called Zlatitsa.<br />
            On the dusty road he lost his glove.<br />
            The wind was blowing, blowing and the glove was<br />
            all of a sudden on the field. <br />
            On the field a little mouse called Nibble was playing. <br />
            She saw the warm glove and hid inside in the warmth of it. <br />
            After a while a scared and cold bunny arrived from the forest.
            <br />
            He saw the glove and asked:<br />
            Who is there hiding in the warmth?<br />
            The mouse answered:<br />
            It is me the little mouse Nibble, who are you and what you want?<br />
            The rabbit answered:<br />
            It is me the Bunny and I am hiding from the words of the humans.
            Also I am cold and wet and scared can I hide with you inside?<br />
            <br />
            Basically the same conversation is being repeated with a: fox,<br />
            wolf, bear. They all start living together. Becoming a metaphor<br />
            for peacefully interspecies existence. <br />
            <br />
            The grandpa meanwhile was searching for the glove. <br />
            The grandma would supposedly been very upset<br />
            and beat him up if he lost it. <br />
            He finds the glove eventually and sees that is moving. <br />
            The animals show their faces through the hole.<br />
            The glove is almost exploding with vibrancy and laughter based<br />
            on the conviviality processes happening inside. <br />
            He kills all the animals and takes the glove home. <br />
            <br />
            I think what I am trying to say is: it is about time for the
            human<br />
            specie to stop exerting violent forces on the other ones for his own
            comfort. A much better ending of the story would be that the grandpa
            joined the group inside the glove becoming the representative<br />
            of the descending from the top of the food chain human and leaving
            the mean grandma alone and behind. <br />
