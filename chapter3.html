    <p id="setting">Setting: The Minotaur and The Protagonist are continuing their journey. After entering through the two first doors of the labyrinth, they have both realized a part of why they could be feeling ashamed or guilty with the lifestyle they have chosen. The next part of the journey would be about trying to
experience alternative ways of living and trying to free themselves of the guilt.
Strolling the dark corridors of the labyrinth. They have been walking without a direction, navigated only by the intuition of the protagonist. They choose to go through a door. Inside two movies are being screened. On the Silver Globe and Walser.</p>
  </p>
  <p><b>Curator</b><br>A group of astronauts land on an Earth-like planet in search for freedom. They accidentally create a new human race, becoming mythic-like god figures. The new human civilization is developing itself, creating their own ethos and culture, infrastructures etc. They stay savages believing in deities, with complex mythical webs defining their origins, manifesting violence, fighting their wars, and awaiting the arrival of their messiah. Soon the civilization is developed on a social and infrastructural level, but they still remain savage, skipping the start of an industrial revolution.<br>A similar detechnologized contemporary landscape can be observed in Walser, a movie by polish conceptual artist Zbigniew Libera. A fictional tribe that inhabits an unknown forest is invaded by a lost official-railway worker representing the civilized world. The main interesting factor of this realization is that the actors playing a role of fictional tribe are a real life commune, which inhabits the outskirts of civilization, somewhere in Sudeten mountains. Libera together with linguist Robert Stiller created a new language in which the tribe communicates. Choosing a real life decivilized community was a very interesting procedure, his decision to select them derives from the observations of daily lifestyle of the commune, which in his opinion will be the most adoptable in the uncivilized post war-apocalyptic landscape, or just simply disconnected from the electricity environment. Their real life abilities, and anti-systemattitude provided them to progress in pragmatism of organic lifestyle.

The Minotaur is taking more initiative in the conversion now. He has submerged in the topics which
the other two are exploring. Playing along. </p>
